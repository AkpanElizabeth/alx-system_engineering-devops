This is the Basic learning structure of NETWORKS

The following are to be considered:
1.OSI Model
What it is
How many layers it has
How it is organize
OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.

It is organized from the lowest level to the highest level:

The lowest level: layer 1 which is for transmission on physical layers with electrical impulse, light or radio signal
The highest level: layer 7 which is for application specific communication like SNMP for emails, HTTP for your web browser, etc
Keep in mind that the OSI model is a concept, it’s not even tangible. The OSI model doesn’t perform any functions in the networking process. It is a conceptual framework so we can better understand complex interactions that are happening. Most of the functionality in the OSI model exists in all communications systems.
 this project we will mainly focus on:

The Transport layer and especially TCP/UDP
On the Network layer with IP and ICMP

What is a LAN
Typical usage
Typical geographical size
A local area network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building.[1] By contrast, a wide area network (WAN) not only covers a larger geographic distance, but also generally involves leased telecommunication circuits.

Ethernet and Wi-Fi are the two most common technologies in use for local area networks. Historical network technologies include ARCNET, Token Ring and AppleTalk.

What is a WAN
Typical usage
Typical geographical size

A wide area network (WAN) is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographic area. Wide area networks are often established with leased telecommunication circuits.[1]

Businesses, as well as schools and government entities, use wide area networks to relay data to staff, students, clients, buyers and suppliers from various locations around the world. In essence, this mode of telecommunication allows a business to effectively carry out its daily function regardless of location. The Internet may be considered a WAN.[2] Many WANs are, however, built for one particular organization and are private. WANs can be separated from local area networks (LANs) in that the latter refers to physically proximal networks.

What is the Internet
The Internet (or internet)[a] is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP)[b] to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the interlinked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.

What is an IP address
Every machine on the the Internet has a unique number assigned to it, called an IP address. Without a unique IP address on your machine, you will not be able to communicate with other devices, users, and computers on the Internet. You can look at your IP address as if it were a telephone number, each one being unique and used to identify a way to reach you and only you.

What are the 2 types of IP address
IPv4 and IPv6 Addresses

There are two flavors of IP Addresses that can be used on a network. The first, and the version that the Internet and most routers are currently configured for, is IPv4 or Internet Protocol version 4. This version uses 32-bit addresses, which limits the amount of addresses to 4,294,967,296 possible unique addresses. Some of these addresses, about 290 million, are also reserved for special purposes. Due to the popular growth of the Internet there has been concern that the pool of possible addresses would be exhausted in the near future. With this in mind, a new version of IP addresses was developed called IPv6, or Internet Protocol version 6, that would change the address size from 32-bit address to 128-bit addresses. This change would allow for generous IP address allocations to networks without any foreseeable problem with the amount of addresses available. In order to use IPv6 addresses, though, existing routers and hardware would need to be upgraded or configured to use this new version of IP addresses.

What is localhost
In computer networking, localhost is a hostname that refers to the current computer used to access it. It is used to access the network services that are running on the host via the loopback network interface. Using the loopback interface bypasses any local network interface hardware.

What is a subnet
